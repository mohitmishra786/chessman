## Introduction

PostgreSQL, one of the most popular open-source relational database management systems, has been making waves in the database community. With its upcoming version 17, currently in beta, PostgreSQL is introducing a game-changing feature: Combined I/O, also known as vectorized I/O. This blog post will delve deep into this new feature, exploring its implementation, benefits, and potential impact on database performance.

## The Rise of PostgreSQL

Before we dive into the technical details, it's worth noting the recent surge in PostgreSQL's popularity. PostgreSQL has become the most popular database in the past two years. This increased attention has led to:

1. More funding for the PostgreSQL community
2. An influx of developers and interested parties
3. The emergence of SaaS companies offering PostgreSQL-based solutions

This growth has ultimately resulted in significant improvements to the PostgreSQL codebase, with Combined I/O being one of the most notable enhancements in version 17.

## Understanding Database Page Operations

To appreciate the significance of Combined I/O, we need to understand how databases typically work with data pages:

### Fixed-Size Pages

Databases, including PostgreSQL, work with fixed-size pages. These are chunks of bytes used for storing various types of data:

- Table data
- Index data
- Transaction logs

Using fixed-size pages simplifies memory management and I/O operations. In PostgreSQL, these pages are typically 8 kilobytes in size.

### Current Read Operations

In current PostgreSQL versions, when the database needs to read a row or an index entry, it translates this operation into a page read (also called a block read). If the required page isn't already in the shared buffer cache, PostgreSQL issues a system call to read the page from disk.

This read operation is performed using the `pread` system call, which allows reading from a specific position in a file. For example, to read an 8KB page, PostgreSQL might issue a call like:

```c
pread(file_descriptor, buffer, 8192, offset);
```

Where:
- `file_descriptor` is the open file
- `buffer` is where the read data will be stored
- `8192` is the number of bytes to read (8KB)
- `offset` is the position in the file to start reading from

### Inefficiencies in Current Approach

While this approach works, it can be inefficient, especially for operations that require reading multiple consecutive pages, such as:

1. Full table scans
2. Index range scans

In these scenarios, PostgreSQL would issue multiple separate system calls, one for each page, even when it knows it will need to read several pages in sequence.

## Introducing Combined I/O

Combined I/O, set to debut in PostgreSQL 17, aims to optimize these read operations by allowing multiple pages to be read with a single system call.

### How Combined I/O Works

1. **Prediction**: When PostgreSQL determines it's likely to need multiple consecutive pages (e.g., during a sequential scan), it predicts how many pages it might need.

2. **Single System Call**: Instead of making multiple `pread` calls, PostgreSQL uses a single system call to read multiple pages at once.

3. **Vectorized Read**: The new approach uses the `preadv` system call, which stands for "vectorized pread". This allows reading into multiple buffers with a single call.

Example usage of `preadv`:

```c
struct iovec iov[3];
iov[0].iov_base = buffer1;
iov[0].iov_len = 8192;
iov[1].iov_base = buffer2;
iov[1].iov_len = 8192;
iov[2].iov_base = buffer3;
iov[2].iov_len = 8192;

preadv(file_descriptor, iov, 3, offset);
```

This single call reads three 8KB pages into three separate buffers.

### Benefits of Combined I/O

1. **Reduced System Call Overhead**: By reducing the number of system calls, Combined I/O minimizes the context switches between user mode and kernel mode, which can be costly in terms of CPU cycles.

2. **Improved I/O Efficiency**: Reading multiple pages in a single operation can lead to more efficient disk I/O, especially for SSDs and NVMe drives that excel at handling larger, contiguous reads.

3. **Better Utilization of Read-Ahead**: While operating systems often perform read-ahead optimizations, Combined I/O allows PostgreSQL to more explicitly control and benefit from larger, more predictable read patterns.

## The Challenges of Combined I/O

While Combined I/O promises significant performance improvements, it also introduces some challenges that the PostgreSQL developers have had to address:

### 1. Determining the Optimal Read Size

One of the key challenges is deciding how many pages to read in a single operation. Reading too few pages might not fully leverage the benefits of Combined I/O, while reading too many could lead to wasted I/O and memory if the extra pages aren't needed.

The PostgreSQL team has implemented heuristics to make this decision, likely considering factors such as:

- The type of operation being performed (e.g., sequential scan vs. index scan)
- Historical access patterns
- Available memory in the shared buffer pool

### 2. Handling Non-Sequential Reads

While Combined I/O is particularly beneficial for sequential reads, PostgreSQL also needs to handle scenarios where multiple non-sequential pages need to be read. The `preadv` system call allows for this by accepting an array of buffer pointers and their corresponding file offsets.

### 3. Balancing with Existing Optimizations

PostgreSQL needs to balance Combined I/O with existing optimizations like the operating system's read-ahead functionality. The goal is to complement, rather than conflict with, these existing optimizations.

### 4. Memory Management

Reading multiple pages at once requires careful management of the shared buffer pool to ensure that the pre-fetched pages don't prematurely evict other important pages from memory.

## The Kernel Connection: Read-Ahead and Page Cache

To fully appreciate Combined I/O, it's important to understand how it relates to existing kernel-level optimizations, particularly read-ahead and the page cache.

### Kernel Read-Ahead

Modern operating systems implement a feature called read-ahead, which attempts to predict and pre-fetch data that an application is likely to need soon. When an application reads from a file, the kernel may decide to read additional blocks beyond what was requested, storing them in the page cache.

Key points about kernel read-ahead:

1. It's based on observed access patterns.
2. It typically works at the block level (often 4KB blocks).
3. The amount of data read ahead is configurable (e.g., via `/sys/block/[device]/queue/read_ahead_kb` on Linux).

### Page Cache

The page cache is a memory area managed by the kernel that stores recently accessed file data. It serves several purposes:

1. Speeds up subsequent reads of the same data.
2. Allows multiple processes to share the same cached data.
3. Provides a buffer for write operations (write-back caching).

Key points about the page cache:

1. It operates at the block level, typically 4KB.
2. It's transparent to applications.
3. It uses an LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm to manage which pages to keep in memory.

### How Combined I/O Interacts with Kernel Mechanisms

PostgreSQL's Combined I/O feature interacts with these kernel mechanisms in several ways:

1. **Complementing Kernel Read-Ahead**: While kernel read-ahead is general-purpose, PostgreSQL's Combined I/O can make more informed decisions based on database-specific knowledge (e.g., knowing it's performing a full table scan).

2. **Optimizing for PostgreSQL's Page Size**: Since PostgreSQL uses 8KB pages and the kernel typically works with 4KB blocks, Combined I/O can ensure that full PostgreSQL pages are read efficiently.

3. **Reducing System Call Overhead**: By reading multiple pages in one call, PostgreSQL reduces the number of times it needs to transition to kernel mode, which can be more efficient than relying solely on kernel read-ahead.

4. **Balancing with Page Cache**: PostgreSQL needs to consider the interaction between its shared buffer pool and the kernel's page cache to avoid redundant caching and optimize memory usage.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Scan Type Detection

PostgreSQL would need to detect when it's performing operations that are likely to benefit from Combined I/O, such as:

- Sequential scans
- Index range scans
- Bitmap heap scans

### 2. Read Size Prediction

An algorithm to predict how many pages to read ahead, possibly considering:

- The type of scan being performed
- Statistics on the table or index being scanned
- Available memory in the shared buffer pool

### 3. Buffer Management

Modifications to the buffer manager to handle:

- Allocating space for multiple pages at once
- Integrating pre-fetched pages into the normal page replacement policy
- Handling scenarios where not all pre-fetched pages are used

### 4. I/O Request Batching

A mechanism to batch multiple page requests into a single `preadv` call, including:

- Collecting read requests from multiple backend processes
- Determining when to issue the batched read
- Handling the distribution of read data back to the requesting processes

### 5. Error Handling

Robust error handling to manage scenarios such as:

- Partial reads (where only some of the requested pages are successfully read)
- I/O errors on some but not all pages in a batch

### 6. Configuration Options

Likely new configuration parameters to control Combined I/O behavior, possibly including:

- Maximum number of pages to read in a single I/O operation
- Thresholds for when to use Combined I/O vs. single-page reads
- Options to disable Combined I/O for specific use cases or testing

## Potential Impact and Performance Considerations

The introduction of Combined I/O in PostgreSQL 17 has the potential to significantly improve performance in several scenarios:

### 1. Large Table Scans

For operations that scan large portions of tables, such as reporting queries or batch processing jobs, Combined I/O could substantially reduce I/O wait times and CPU overhead from system calls.

### 2. Index Range Scans

Queries that perform range scans on indexes, especially those with high selectivity, could see improved performance due to more efficient pre-fetching of leaf pages.

### 3. Bulk Data Loading

Operations that read large amounts of data sequentially, such as bulk data imports or COPY operations, may benefit from the reduced system call overhead.

### 4. OLAP Workloads

Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) workloads, which often involve scanning large portions of tables, could see significant performance improvements.

### Performance Considerations

While Combined I/O promises performance improvements, its impact will vary depending on several factors:

1. **Storage Type**: The benefits may be more pronounced on SSDs and NVMe drives, which can handle larger I/O operations more efficiently than traditional HDDs.

2. **Workload Characteristics**: Workloads with more sequential access patterns will benefit more than those with random access patterns.

3. **Available Memory**: The effectiveness of Combined I/O will depend on having sufficient memory in the shared buffer pool to accommodate the pre-fetched pages without causing excessive evictions.

4. **System Resources**: The reduced CPU overhead from fewer system calls may be more noticeable on systems with high CPU utilization.

5. **Concurrency**: The impact on highly concurrent workloads with many small queries remains to be seen and will likely require careful tuning.

## Comparison with Other Databases

1. **Oracle**: Has long had a "multiblock read" feature that allows reading multiple database blocks in a single I/O operation.

2. **MySQL/InnoDB**: Implements "read-ahead" at the storage engine level, which can read multiple pages in a single I/O operation.

3. **SQL Server**: Uses "read-ahead" to pre-fetch data pages it predicts will be needed soon.

PostgreSQL's implementation of Combined I/O brings it more in line with these other databases in terms of I/O optimization capabilities.

## Future Directions and Potential Enhancements

As Combined I/O is a new feature in PostgreSQL 17, we can expect further refinements and enhancements in future versions. Some potential areas for improvement might include:

1. **Dynamic Adjustment**: More sophisticated algorithms to dynamically adjust the number of pages read based on observed workload patterns and system conditions.

2. **Integration with Query Optimizer**: Allowing the query optimizer to provide hints about expected access patterns to inform Combined I/O decisions.

3. **Asynchronous I/O**: Combining the benefits of Combined I/O with asynchronous I/O to further improve I/O parallelism.

4. **Storage-Aware Optimizations**: Tailoring Combined I/O behavior based on the capabilities of the underlying storage system (e.g., different strategies for SSDs vs. HDDs).

## Conclusion

The introduction of Combined I/O in PostgreSQL 17 represents a significant step forward in I/O optimization for the database system. By reducing system call overhead and allowing for more efficient disk access patterns, this feature has the potential to improve performance for a wide range of database operations, particularly those involving sequential access to large amounts of data.

As with any new feature, the true impact of Combined I/O will become clearer as it's tested and deployed in real-world scenarios. Database administrators and developers should look forward to experimenting with this feature and tuning it for their specific workloads.

The addition of Combined I/O also demonstrates the ongoing commitment of the PostgreSQL community to improving the performance and capabilities of the database system. As PostgreSQL continues to grow in popularity, we can expect to see more such innovations that push the boundaries of database performance and efficiency.
