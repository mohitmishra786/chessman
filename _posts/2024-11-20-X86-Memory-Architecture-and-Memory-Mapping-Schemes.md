## Introduction

The x86 architecture represents a fundamental paradigm in computer architecture, implementing sophisticated memory management schemes that have evolved from 32-bit to 64-bit systems. This documentation provides an in-depth analysis of the memory mapping mechanisms, kernel mode address spaces, and the architectural differences between 32-bit and 64-bit implementations.

Memory management in x86 architecture is crucial for system stability, security, and performance. The architecture implements a segmented memory model that provides isolation between different memory regions, enabling efficient memory access patterns and protection mechanisms.

## Memory Architecture Overview

The x86 memory architecture implements a hierarchical memory management system that supports both physical and virtual memory addressing. The system utilizes several key components:

1. Memory Management Unit (MMU)
   - Handles address translation between virtual and physical addresses
   - Implements memory protection mechanisms
   - Manages page tables and translation lookaside buffers (TLB)

2. Address Translation Mechanism
   - Converts virtual addresses to physical addresses
   - Implements page-level protection
   - Manages memory access rights

3. Protection Rings
   - Ring 0: Kernel mode (highest privilege)
   - Ring 1-2: Device drivers and system services
   - Ring 3: User mode (lowest privilege)

## 32-bit Memory Mapping

The 32-bit memory mapping scheme implements a 4GB address space divided into distinct segments, each serving specific purposes in the memory hierarchy.

## Memory Mapping Implementation

Here's a C code example demonstrating memory mapping implementation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

// Structure to represent memory segments
typedef struct {
    uint64_t start_addr;
    uint64_t end_addr;
    int flags;
    const char* name;
} MemorySegment;

// Function to initialize memory segments
void init_memory_segments(MemorySegment* segments, int is_64bit) {
    if (is_64bit) {
        segments[0] = (MemorySegment){
            .start_addr = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFULL,
            .end_addr = 0xFFFFFFFFE0000000ULL,
            .flags = MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS,
            .name = "xkseg3"
        };
        // Initialize other 64-bit segments...
    } else {
        segments[0] = (MemorySegment){
            .start_addr = 0xFFFFFFFF,
            .end_addr = 0xE0000000,
            .flags = MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS,
            .name = "kseg3"
        };
        // Initialize other 32-bit segments...
    }
}

// Function to map memory segment
void* map_segment(MemorySegment* segment) {
    void* addr = mmap(
        (void*)segment->start_addr,
        segment->end_addr - segment->start_addr,
        PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
        segment->flags,
        -1,
        0
    );
    
    if (addr == MAP_FAILED) {
        perror("Memory mapping failed");
        return NULL;
    }
    
    return addr;
}

int main() {
    MemorySegment segments[5];
    int is_64bit = sizeof(void*) == 8;
    
    init_memory_segments(segments, is_64bit);
    
    // Map each segment
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        void* mapped_addr = map_segment(&segments[i]);
        if (mapped_addr) {
            printf("Successfully mapped %s at address %p\n", 
                   segments[i].name, mapped_addr);
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
